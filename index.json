As constant change occurs in the physical plane, the magic plane is forced to adapt around it. The defined elements of the magical plane come from memories and understanding of those around them. The magical plane is inhabited by several creatures. These magical beings take several forms. Dreams, nightmares, thoughts, and wandering imaginations take forms as wisps of little floating energy which provide light to the world around them. They are trapped inside the person who concocted them, as people share them, or forget them. The wisps leave the bodies and take form into larger beings called abarritions. Abarritions are shambling shapeless beings floating, they have the power to move into and out of people\u0026rsquo;s minds, as they do, they leave pieces of themself which grow before eventually leaving back into the wisp stage. If an abarrition exists long enough it begins to take the shape of the thoughts and ideas of the world around them, growing from apparitions, to spirits, demons, deities, devil, angels, and anything else the world can dream. These beings grow powerful enough to leave the magical plane to visit the physical plane. Here, they grow more powerful as gods or legends. It’s theorized that with enough time, the rebirth of dragons may be possible, though as of yet it is only a concept. Items and beings of legend like sunken ships and forests full of fairies and beasts will spring up taking a life of their own. Becoming haunted pirate ships which roam the seas looking for treasure and revenge, or forests of living trees and magical fruits.\nMagic is not only defined by the beings it creates however, magic itself is the element defined by the energy of creation, known as Mana. Magic can not be created nor destroyed; it only is transformed before it takes time to reshape itself into Mana. A person can only store so much magic, this is defined by their ability to cause the transformation as they channel it into spells. Very few can but some have the ability to force mana out of their system. This art, known as blood casting, is dangerous and frowned upon in the magic community as it attempts to break the natural flow of energy the planes provided to them.\nMost people can only experience the magical planes through the act of astral projection, a form of meditation which reveals the energy of the universe to the people who seek it. Wisps and abarritions, along with the magic inside of people or items will make itself apparent through astral projection. During this time the projecting person sees magic as colorful glowing auras, these auras can help define current thoughts or intentions, though the exact nature is not consistent.\nMagic at the Start # The earliest experience with magic in the physical planes came from the birth of local legends into reality. Descriptions and stories describing occurrences in the world eventually became true. Beings from the magic plane were birthed into the world to answer the questions about the natural occurrences around them. These traditional stories and tales have kept up, though the origins of them are now understood, and their deities have often faded back into the wisps or abarritions they were birthed from to be recycled back into new legends.\nThe Beginning of The Age of Knowledge # Magic as a defined science became defined with the understanding of the six natural elements which make up the magical plane: Order, Chaos, Life, Death, Light, and Dark. Each of these has a different pantheon, each god of which controls lesser elements. These elements form the alphabet for each language which is used to conjure to cast a spell. Different combinations of these alphabets are conjured by motion and sounds in a combination. When added together in specific order they form the spells people use.\nUnderstanding magic was originally kept to the more educated classes, as the ability to learn and understand these languages took years of study and practice which most folk could not afford. Additionally, the understanding of why the spell combination caused a spell was considered only for those graced by these pantheon members, and spell casters were often sought out as for positions of power within a society.\nThe only way a common man would come into the understanding of magics, would be to take an apprenticeship with a spiritual leader, an enchanter, or a magical healer.\nThe Scourge # The scourge, or being scourged occurs when there is too much magical use in an area. The mana cycle dictates that after magic is used for spells, it becomes aether, aether is turned back into mana through the use of chi arts by humans or animals. Scourging causes mutations to the body over time, these mutations can get aggressive in their later stages fully mutating the affected into devils, demons, or monsters. Communities of sapient beings are often exiled from their communities because of their danger and their aggression.\n","date":"25 February 2023","permalink":"/docs/lore-magic-plane/","section":"Docs","summary":"Visual Description # The magical planes are a constantly evolving space which adapts based on the physical space around them.

Perception checks that require only sound to detect Khari are negative.\nFeline Dexterity: Khari can use a half action to dash once every turn.\nOptional Fluff: Khari are uniformly beautiful, with even the least flattering among them standing head and shoulders over most humans. This uniform beauty has led to the common practice of Khari hiding their faces behind masks. Each mask is carefully crafted and unique to the individual, and most Khari communities will consider themself unfit to be seen in public without one.\nLore # Picture of a khari woman Known as “the children\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; in their own language, khari are a petite, lithe race of extraterrestrial bipeds originally hailing from the planet Jo\u0026rsquo;suun. They have slender limbs covered in soft fur at the forearm and shin, and their teeth and sharp claws make even an unarmed khari a vicious opponent. Khari possess long ears with a tuft of fur at the tip, capable of hearing frequencies inaudible to humans, and their keen feline eyes allow them to pick up the subtlest traces of movement, even in absolute darkness. The most intriguing quirk of khari biology is the direct result of their homeworld. Jo\u0026rsquo;suun was an arid world with very little breathable air. The surface of the planet suffered near constant sandstorms, forcing life to flourish around underground rivers and lakes. To compensate for the lack of oxygen, the khari evolved to communicate through mostly non-verbal means, developing them into an empathetic people adept at reading body language and emotion.\nAll khari share a fear of the entity they call \u0026ldquo;the thing that hungers\u0026rdquo;, and as such have developed ways to stave off death. Thanks to their societal skill with kinesis, the khari have developed a process to bind a subjects mind and spirit to a vessel (traditionally the subjects own bleached skeleton) thus sparing the soul from being reabsorbed into the magic plane, and saving the mind from being devoured by the entity we know as The Father.\nThe khari first came to our world late in the second era, when a conclave of orcs in the Southern Sahn activated a device known as a dragon gate in an attempt to find a living dragon. What they found instead was chaos. Across the universe, Jo\u0026rsquo;suun was being ravaged by a plague identical to the grey virus that would threaten our world in less than a thousand years. The khari, escaping through their own dragon gate, came through as refugees from a dying world. The orc empress, Taalia Ghakt, granted the wayward khari a plot of \u0026ldquo;unused land\u0026rdquo; recently taken from disparate human tribes along the Serpent River. The orcs had no real use for it as it lacked the natural resources they required. The khari, naturally accustomed to surviving in conditions earthlings would deem inhospitable, accepted eagerly.\nOver the next three generations, khari would settle in what became known as Khari\u0026rsquo;haal (home of the children), But as time went on, the elder khari grew increasingly distressed as their children and grandchildren became more and more native. It was the fourth generation that tipped the scales. The fourth generation of khari on Earth consisted of a small minority of half-bred children. These half-khari (called hanu\u0026rsquo;khari or \u0026ldquo;wild children \u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; by the khari) had no ability to communicate telepathically, and frequently only adopted their long ears and feline eyes from their khari parents. Fearing that their race would eventually be diluted to nothing, the khari lashed out against their neighbors, khari radicals often burning the homes and businesses of non-khari.\n","date":"24 February 2023","permalink":"/docs/race-khari/","section":"Docs","summary":"Stat Block # Hardiness Strength Dexterity Acuity Charisma Arcana Intelligence Logic Starting 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 Limit 11 11 12 11 11 12 11 10 (Panthera Sapien Acutis) are the descendants of desert dwelling panthers of planet","title":"Khari"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
