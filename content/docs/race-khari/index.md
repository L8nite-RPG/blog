*(Panthera Sapien Acutis)* are the descendants of desert dwelling panthers of planet 

**Wilde Grace:** Most Khari make barely any sound when moving normally. Perception checks that require only sound to detect Khari are negative.

**Feline Dexterity:** Khari can use a half action to dash once every turn.

Optional Fluff: Khari are uniformly beautiful, with even the least flattering among them standing head and shoulders over most humans. This uniform beauty has led to the common practice of Khari hiding their faces behind masks. Each mask is carefully crafted and unique to the individual, and most Khari communities will consider themself unfit to be seen in public without one.

## Lore

Known as “the children'' in their own language, khari are a petite, lithe race of extraterrestrial bipeds originally hailing from the planet Jo'suun. They have slender limbs covered in soft fur at the forearm and shin, and their teeth and sharp claws make even an unarmed khari a vicious opponent. Khari possess long ears with a tuft of fur at the tip, capable of hearing frequencies inaudible to humans, and their keen feline eyes allow them to pick up the subtlest traces of movement, even in absolute darkness. The most intriguing quirk of khari biology is the direct result of their homeworld. Jo'suun was an arid world with very little breathable air. The surface of the planet suffered near constant sandstorms, forcing life to flourish around underground rivers and lakes. To compensate for the lack of oxygen, the khari evolved to communicate through mostly non-verbal means, developing them into an empathetic people adept at reading body language and emotion.


All khari share a fear of the entity they call "the thing that hungers", and as such have developed ways to stave off death. Thanks to their societal skill with kinesis, the khari have developed a process to bind a subjects mind and spirit to a vessel (traditionally the subjects own bleached skeleton) thus sparing the soul from being reabsorbed into the magic plane, and saving the mind from being devoured by the entity we know as The Father.


The khari first came to our world late in the second era, when a conclave of orcs in the Southern Sahn activated a device known as a dragon gate in an attempt to find a living dragon. What they found instead was chaos. Across the universe, Jo'suun was being ravaged by a plague identical to the grey virus that would threaten our world in less than a thousand years. The khari, escaping through their own dragon gate, came through as refugees from a dying world. The orc empress, Taalia Ghakt, granted the wayward khari a plot of "unused land" recently taken from disparate human tribes along the Serpent River. The orcs had no real use for it as it lacked the natural resources they required. The khari, naturally accustomed to surviving in conditions earthlings would deem inhospitable, accepted eagerly.


Over the next three generations, khari would settle in what became known as Khari'haal (home of the children), But as time went on, the elder khari grew increasingly distressed as their children and grandchildren became more and more native. It was the fourth generation that tipped the scales. The fourth generation of khari on Earth consisted of a small minority of half-bred children. These half-khari (called hanu'khari or "wild children '' by the khari) had no ability to communicate telepathically, and frequently only adopted their long ears and feline eyes from their khari parents. Fearing that their race would eventually be diluted to nothing, the khari lashed out against their neighbors, khari radicals often burning the homes and businesses of non-khari.
