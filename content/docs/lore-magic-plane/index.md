## Visual Description

The magical planes are a constantly evolving space which adapts based on the physical space around them. As constant change occurs in the physical plane, the magic plane is forced to adapt around it. The defined elements of the magical plane come from memories and understanding of those around them. The magical plane is inhabited by several creatures. These magical beings take several forms. Dreams, nightmares, thoughts, and wandering imaginations take forms as wisps of little floating energy which provide light to the world around them. They are trapped inside the person who concocted them, as people share them, or forget them. The wisps leave the bodies and take form into larger beings called abarritions. Abarritions are shambling shapeless beings floating, they have the power to move into and out of people's minds, as they do, they leave pieces of themself which grow before eventually leaving back into the wisp stage. If an abarrition exists long enough it begins to take the shape of the thoughts and ideas of the world around them, growing from apparitions, to spirits, demons, deities, devil, angels, and anything else the world can dream. These beings grow powerful enough to leave the magical plane to visit the physical plane. Here, they grow more powerful as gods or legends. Itâ€™s theorized that with enough time, the rebirth of dragons may be possible, though as of yet it is only a concept. Items and beings of legend like sunken ships and forests full of fairies and beasts will spring up taking a life of their own. Becoming haunted pirate ships which roam the seas looking for treasure and revenge, or forests of living trees and magical fruits. 

Magic is not only defined by the beings it creates however, magic itself is the element defined by the energy of creation, known as Mana. Magic can not be created nor destroyed; it only is transformed before it takes time to reshape itself into Mana. A person can only store so much magic, this is defined by their ability to cause the transformation as they channel it into spells. Very few can but some have the ability to force mana out of their system. This art, known as blood casting, is dangerous and frowned upon in the magic community as it attempts to break the natural flow of energy the planes provided to them. 

Most people can only experience the magical planes through the act of astral projection, a form of meditation which reveals the energy of the universe to the people who seek it. Wisps and abarritions, along with the magic inside of people or items will make itself apparent through astral projection. During this time the projecting person sees magic as colorful glowing auras, these auras can help define current thoughts or intentions, though the exact nature is not consistent.

The earliest experience with magic in the physical planes came from the birth of local legends into reality. Descriptions and stories describing occurrences in the world eventually became true. Beings from the magic plane were birthed into the world to answer the questions about the natural occurrences around them. These traditional stories and tales have kept up, though the origins of them are now understood, and their deities have often faded back into the wisps or abarritions they were birthed from to be recycled back into new legends.

Magic as a defined science became defined with the understanding of the six natural elements which make up the magical plane: Order, Chaos, Life, Death, Light, and Dark. Each of these has a different pantheon, each god of which controls lesser elements. These elements form the alphabet for each language which is used to conjure to cast a spell. Different combinations of these alphabets are conjured by motion and sounds in a combination. When added together in specific order they form the spells people use.

Understanding magic was originally kept to the more educated classes, as the ability to learn and understand these languages took years of study and practice which most folk could not afford. Additionally, the understanding of why the spell combination caused a spell was considered only for those graced by these pantheon members, and spell casters were often sought out as for positions of power within a society.

The only way a common man would come into the understanding of magics, would be to take an apprenticeship with a spiritual leader, an enchanter, or a magical healer.

The scourge, or being scourged occurs when there is too much magical use in an area. The mana cycle dictates that after magic is used for spells, it becomes aether, aether is turned back into mana through the use of chi arts by humans or animals. Scourging causes mutations to the body over time, these mutations can get aggressive in their later stages fully mutating the affected into devils, demons, or monsters. Communities of sapient beings are often exiled from their communities because of their danger and their aggression.
